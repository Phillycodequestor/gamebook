		<p>A long time ago in a galaxy far far away ... Darth Trump threatened to smash the rebellion and rule the galaxy if he got elected. His second in command, Darth Pence, along with Christie the Hutt, kidnapped Princess Hillarleia. Your mission is to rescue the princess and convince a voter not to support Darth Trump, saving the galaxy from his evil clutches. Do you accept this mission? Answer Y or N.</p>

		You have entered the hideout of Christie the Hutt. Christie issues a challenge: He will release Princess Hillarleia if you win a light-saber fight with Darth Pence. If you opt not to fight, Darth Trump could choose not to challenge you later, since the princess isn't free, and you will automatically lose. Will you fight Darth Pence? Answer Y or N?
